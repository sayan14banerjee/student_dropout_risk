# Student Dropout Risk

This project leverages data-driven methods to analyze and predict the risk of student dropout. By identifying at-risk students early, educational institutions can implement targeted interventions to improve retention rates.

## Features

- Data preprocessing and cleaning
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Predictive modeling using machine learning algorithms
- Model evaluation and performance metrics
- Visualization of results

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Student_Dropout_Risk.git
    cd Student_Dropout_Risk
    ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. **Run the analysis:**
    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```
